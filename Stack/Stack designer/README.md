# Stack designer 
You are given an array `arr` of size `N`. You need to push the elements of the array into a stack and then print them while popping.

## Examples
```
Input:
n = 5
arr = {1 2 3 4 5}
Output:
5 4 3 2 1
```
```
Input: 
n = 7
arr = {1 6 43 1 2 0 5}
Output: 
5 0 2 1 43 6 1
```
## Constraints
