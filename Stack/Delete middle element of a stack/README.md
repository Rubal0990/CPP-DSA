# Delete middle element of a stack
Given a stack with <b>push(), pop(), empty()</b> operations, delete the <b>middle</b> of the stack without using any additional data structure.

<b>Middle:</b> ceil(size_of_stack/2.0)
 

## Examples
```
Input: 
Stack = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output:
ModifiedStack = {1, 2, 4, 5}
Explanation:
As the number of elements is 5 , 
hence the middle element will be the 3rd
element which is deleted
```
```
Input: 
Stack = {1 2 3 4}
Output:
ModifiedStack = {1 3 4}
Explanation:
As the number of elements is 4 , 
hence the middle element will be the 2nd
element which is deleted
```

## Constraints
* 2 ≤ size of stack ≤ 100
